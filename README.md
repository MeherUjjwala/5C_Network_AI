Nested U-Net (U-Net++)
Nested U-Net, also known as U-Net++, is an advanced version of the original U-Net architecture. It introduces dense skip connections between the encoder and decoder sub-networks. These connections aim to reduce the semantic gap between the feature maps of the encoder and decoder, making it easier for the optimizer to learn relevant features.                     Application to Metastasis Segmentation:

Dense Skip Connections: These connections help in capturing fine-grained details, which is crucial for accurately segmenting small metastases.
Deep Supervision: This ensures that the model learns robust features at multiple levels, improving segmentation accuracy.
Attention U-Net
Attention U-Net incorporates attention mechanisms into the U-Net architecture. These mechanisms allow the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input image, enhancing the segmentation of important regions while ignoring irrelevant background.                                                                                                                 Application to Metastasis Segmentation:

Attention Mechanisms: These mechanisms help the model to focus on metastasis regions, improving the accuracy of segmentation by highlighting the areas of interest.
Enhanced Feature Extraction: By focusing on relevant features, the model can better differentiate between metastasis and normal tissue.                                                                                                           FastAPI Backend

Small Size of Metastases: Metastases can be very small and difficult to detect.
Class Imbalance: There are often more normal tissues than metastases, leading to class imbalance.
Variability in Appearance: Metastases can vary greatly in size, shape, and intensity.                                   Addressing the challenges:
Nested U-Net: The dense skip connections and deep supervision help in capturing fine details and learning robust features, which is crucial for detecting small metastases.
Attention U-Net: The attention mechanisms focus on relevant regions, improving the modelâ€™s ability to detect and segment metastases accurately.
Data Augmentation: Techniques like rotation, zoom, and shift help in addressing variability and class imbalance by generating diverse training samples.
